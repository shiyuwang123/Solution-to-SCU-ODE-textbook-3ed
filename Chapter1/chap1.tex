\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{Exercise \arabic*:}]
    \item
    \textbf{Problem:} \\
    An boat is traveling at a constant speed $v_0$ towards the bank of a river vertically. The flow speed of the river is on the 
    $x$ axis and the absolute value is Proportional to the distance from both banks. The proportionality constant is $k$. 
    the width of the river is $a$. Find the equation of the trajectory of the boat.

    \textbf{Solution:} \\
    Let the position of the boat be $(x,y)$, where $y$ is the distance from the bottom bank. The speed of the boat relative to the ground is
    \[\frac{dx}{dt} = ky(a-y), \quad \frac{dy}{dt} = v_0.\]
    Thus, we have
    \[\frac{dx}{dy} = \frac{ky(a-y)}{v_0}.\]
    Integrating both sides, we get
    \[x = \frac{ka}{2v_0}y^2 +\frac{ky^3}{3v_0} + C.\]
    If we assume the boat starts from the bottom bank at $y=0$ and $x=0$, then $C=0$. Therefore, the equation of the trajectory is
    \[x = \frac{ka}{2v_0}y^2 +\frac{ky^3}{3v_0}.\]

    \item
    \textbf{Problem:} \\
    Determine the differential equation of a curve in the Cartesian Oxt-plane such that,
     at each point of the curve, the tangent line together with the radius vector 
     to that point and the x-axis forms an isosceles triangle.


    \textbf{Solution:} \\
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item First scenario: the absolute value of radius vector is the same as the length 
        of the tangent line segment from the point of tangency to the x-axis.

        Here, the length of radius vector is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, and the length of the tangent 
        line segment from the point of tangency to the x-axis is $\sqrt{(t\frac{dx}{dt})^2+y^2}$.

        Applying the isosceles triangle condition, we have
        \[\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{(t\frac{dx}{dt})^2+y^2}.\]
        Squaring both sides and simplifying, we get
        \[x^2 = (t\frac{dx}{dt})^2.\]
        Taking the square root of both sides, we have
        \[x = t\frac{dx}{dt} \quad \text{or} \quad x = -t\frac{dx}{dt}.\]
        Rearranging, we obtain the differential equations
        \[\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{x}{t} \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{dx}{dt} = -\frac{x}{t}.\]

        \item Second scenario: the absolute value of radius vector is the same as the length 
        of the x-axis segment from the origin to the intersection of the tangent line with the x-axis.

        Here, the length of radius vector is $\sqrt{x^2 + t^2}$, and the length of the x-axis
        segment from the origin to the intersection of the tangent line with the x-axis is $x - t\frac{dx}{dt}$

        Applying the isosceles triangle condition, we have
        \[\sqrt{x^2 + t^2} = x - t\frac{dx}{dt}.\]
        Squaring both sides and simplifying, we get
        \[x^2 + t^2 = x^2 - 2xt\frac{dx}{dt} + (t\frac{dx}{dt})^2.\]
        Rearranging, we obtain the differential equation
        \[t^2 = - 2xt\frac{dx}{dt} + (t\frac{dx}{dt})^2.\]
        Dividing both sides by $t^2$ (assuming $t \neq 0$), we have
        \[1 = - 2\frac{x}{t}\frac{dx}{dt} + (\frac{dx}{dt})^2.\]
        Rearranging, we get
        \[(\frac{dx}{dt})^2 - 2\frac{x}{t}\frac{dx}{dt} - 1 = 0.\]
        Solving this quadratic equation for $\frac{dx}{dt}$, we find
        \[\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{x}{t} \pm \sqrt{(\frac{x}{t})^2 + 1}.\]

        \item Third scenario: the length of the tangent line segment from the point of tangency to the x-axis
        is the same as the length of the x-axis segment from the origin to the intersection of the tangent line with the x-axis.

        Here, the length of the tangent line segment from the point of tangency to the x-axis is $\sqrt{(t\frac{dx}{dt})^2+y^2}$, and the length of the x-axis segment from the origin to the intersection of the tangent line with the
        x-axis is $x - t\frac{dx}{dt}$.

        Applying the isosceles triangle condition, we have
        \[\sqrt{(t\frac{dx}{dt})^2+t^2} = x - t\frac{dx}{dt}.\]
        Squaring both sides and simplifying, we get
        \[(t\frac{dx}{dt})^2+t^2 = x^2 - 2xt\frac{dx}{dt} + (t\frac{dx}{dt})^2.\]
        Rearranging, we obtain the differential equation
        \[y^2 = x^2 - 2xt\frac{dx}{dt}.\]
        Dividing both sides by $t^2$ (assuming $t \neq 0$), we have
        \[1 = (\frac{x}{t})^2 - 2\frac{x}{t}\frac{dx}{dt}.\]
        Rearranging, we get
        \[2\frac{x}{t}\frac{dx}{dt} = (\frac{x}{t})^2 - 1.\]
        Thus, the differential equation is
        \[\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{(\frac{x}{t})^2 - 1}{2\frac{x}{t}}.\]
